# openshift-jenkins-operator
An operator-managed OpenShift Jenkins for OpenShift 4.x

## Requirements

## Installation

## Run
To run the operator locally, you need to have your OpenShift clusters active, by either:
- `oc login your-server -u your-user -p your-password` : This sets your active credentials in ~/.kube/config
- `export KUBECONFIG=/home/user/path/to/kubeconfig`

Then simply run:
`make local`
